# Getting Started with Bioconductor

<hero small>This guide helps R / Bioconductor users: establish and familiarize themselves with essential Terra account and workspace concepts; use RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks; and execute workflows for large-scale analysis with R / Bioconductor, including management of workflows from within R. The guide indicates how to discover R / Bioconductor workspaces, and how the R / Bioconductor community can contribute to AnVIL and cloud-based computation.</hero>

## AnVIL Basics

- [Getting Started with AnVIL][] provides essential informtaion for setting up a Terra account, billing and cost management, use of terra workspaces, finding and accessing (public as well as protected) consortium-scale data, and running workflows and interactive analyses.

## R / Bioconductor with RStudio or Jupyter

## The AnVIL Package

## Workflows

# R / Bioconductor Workspaces

# Community Participation
