# Getting Started with Bioconductor

<hero small>This guide helps R / Bioconductor users: establish and familiarize themselves with essential Terra account and workspace concepts; use RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis; execute workflows for large-scale, including use of R / Bioconductor in the workflow, and management of workflows from within R. The guide indicates how to discover R / Bioconductor workspaces, and how the R / Bioconductor community can contribute to AnVIL and cloud-based computation.</hero>

## AnVIL Basics

- [Getting Started with AnVIL][] provides essential informtaion for setting up a Terra account, billing and cost management, use of terra workspaces, finding and accessing (public as well as protected) consortium-scale data, and running workflows and interactive analyses.

## R / Bioconductor with RStudio or Jupyter

Getting started

- Using an RStudio Runtime.

- Using a Jupyter Runtime.

Terra / AnVIL concepts

- Workspaces, Runtimes, and Persistent Disks.

- DATA and Buckets.

- Sharing and Cloning.

- Billing and Cost Control.

## Workflows

- A Bulk RNASeq Differential Expression Workflow.

- Workflow Inputs, Execution, and Outputs.

## The AnVIL Package

- Interact with Terra.

- Manage Cloud Resources.
